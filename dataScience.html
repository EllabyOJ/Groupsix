        <h3>ANALYSIS AND DEDUCTION FROM THE POLITICAL POLL DATA SET</h3>
        </div>
        <main>
        <p>
         In Nigeria, we have so many political parties and aspirants for different positions without  no actual means of finding out who belong to which party as well as what position are avalaible.Also, supporters are really distant from their people and getting to know them is quite difficult.<br> 
         Our analysis is based on solving the problem stated above, hence we began working  with 4   political parties (APC, PDP, AGPA and SDP), a survey was carried out which helped us distinguish the number of people who are familiar with the parties and those who are not familiar with them from those who are familiar with candidates of the party and those who are not.<br> 
         At the end of the analysis, we were able to deduce that APC has the highest awareness and it is safe to call APC the people’s party. APC held up to 37.8% awareness.
         PDP was next after APC; it held up to 36.6% awareness which is still very much out there and in the people’s face. From the survey, we can call PDP a rival of APC, any vote that skipped APC was most likely to be passed to PDP.

        <div>
            <p>
        This list is followed by AGPA, holding 18.3% awareness which is no close to the APC and PDP while SDP is almost out of the reader, holding the least percentage of 7.3%. This tells us that this SDP was not known as much, they had little or no presence out there compared to APC and PDP.
        Apparently, APC and PDP are the most popular and known parties. PDP was founded in 1998 and APC formed in 2013.         They both have had their terms and have been in power but as we know, APC is topping the list as she is currently         position as seen below.

            <p>
                From Nigeria’s population statistics, we have deduced the following: 
     1.51.9% of people are not eligible to vote as they are not of age<br>
<br> 2. 48.1% of people are eligible to exercise their franchise. They are between the age of 18 and above.      30% of this 48.1% are the millennials, they are the set of youth surfing the net, who are very familiar with and have unrestricted access to social media
<br> 3.While the 18.1% are the advanced in years who are not socially inclined as the millennials<br> 
 Having identified the problem, we are breaking the bias by creating a platform where every political party, positions and candidates will be listed such that politicians can register and be verified, having a profile that can help track views, visits, make post that enables them have a larger reach and run campaigns for monetary support.  Hence, we draw our conclusion that our website will perfectly fit in as a solution to solving the problem since the millennials who are socially inclined are also eligible to exercise their franchise
